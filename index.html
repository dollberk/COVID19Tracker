            <h1>COVID-19 SYMPTOM TRACKER</h1>
		<h2>What is this?</h2>
		<p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new illness that affects the lungs,
			airways, and blood vessels. The time it takes to develop COVID-19
			symptoms can range from one to fourteen days. This symptom checker
			will assess your likelihood of being infected with disease. This application will also
			display a heat map to help you and your loved ones understand which areas of
			New Jersey are reporting high amounts of COVID-19 cases.
		</p>
		<h2>Why should I take this?</h2>
		<p>You can complete this survey for yourself or on behalf of someone who is unable
			to. With increased public knowledge of symptoms and exposure, we can work
			together to end this virus. This survey is intended to be a tool in making informed
			decisions. The COVID-19 Symptom Survey is not professional medical advice.
		</p>

		<h2>Where can I get more information?</h2>
		<p>You should consult with a licensed healthcare provider with further questions. For
			more information, visit <a href="covid19.nj.gov"> covid19.nj.gov </a>
